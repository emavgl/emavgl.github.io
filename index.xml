I am a Software Engineer with experience in designing and implementing big data platforms. I have a strong background in data engineering, cloud computing, distributed systems and security. I am originally from Sicily, Italy, but currently living in Linz, Austria. In my free time, I enjoy running, cooking (and eating), reading, and exploring new places. I am looking for a new challenge as a Software Engineer in a dynamic and innovative company.</description></item><item><title>Blog</title><link>http://www.example.com/blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.example.com/blog/</guid><description>Nothing to see here&amp;hellip; yet!</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>http://www.example.com/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.example.com/projects/</guid><description>Oinkoin Oinkoin Money Manager makes managing personal finances easy and secure.
