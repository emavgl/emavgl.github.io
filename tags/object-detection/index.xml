In this blog, I will share my thoughts, in order to help new engineers in making the correct choices when they are setting up the dataset pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Comparing a transformer-based detector with a classical detector</title><link>https://emavgl.github.io/posts/third-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emavgl.github.io/posts/third-blog/</guid><description>Table Of Contents 🔥 Motivation 🔫 Dataset Description 🔩 Set-Up 🩺Results 👍 Coco Metric CNN 👍 Coco Metric Transformers 🙏 Comments &amp;amp; Feedback Follow me 👇 🔥 Motivation Link to heading Since the introduction, by Facebook, Transformer based detectors are getting a lot of traction in Computer Vision and Object Detection.
In this blog, I will show how a partially trained detector using SWIN transformer backbone leads to a very competitive performance compared to a fully trained classical detector.</description></item></channel></rss>
