I help companies design, build, and deploy end-to-end deep learning solutions.
I specialize in Computer Vision, Tabular Data, Computational Mechanics.
My workflow emphasizes data-centric modeling and deployment strategies.

What I bring to the table:

<p>游릴 3+ years of modeling DL-based computer vision algorithms.</p>
<p>游릴 3+ years of helping companies deploy DL models into production.</p>

<p>游릴 10+ Python Programming</p>
<p>游릴 Proven ability to think from first principles in designing high quality, scalable DL- based solutions.</p>
<p>游릴 Unique combination of technical know-hows and communicating to non-technical audience through written and spoken medium.</p>
<p>游릴 Multilingual: English, Italian, Spanish</p>

Tech stack:
<p>游릴 Python, Docker, Jupyter, Pycharm, Git.</p>
<p>游릴 DL framework: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Fastai, IceVision</p>
<p>游릴 DL experiment: Weights & Biases, CometML, Optuna.</p>
<p>游릴 DL deployment: OpenVINO, TensorRT, ONNX, TFLite, Hugging Face Hub, DeepSparse.</p>

Besides my technical interests, I generally have a growth mindset and am interested in staying physically and mentally fit. 
When family affairs allow me I am keen cyclist, skier, kitesurfer and skidiver as well as running and swimming.
