My name is Emanuele and I am originally from the beautiful island of Sicily in Italy. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Catania, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data and Security at Univerisity of Trento. Following my studies, I worked as a Researcher at Fondazione Bruno Kessler for two years before moving to Linz, Austria to join the Data Team at Runtastic as a Software Engineer. In my free time, I enjoy running, cooking (and eating), reading, and exploring new places.

## Experiences

- **[2020-2023] Software Engineer (Data) at Runtastic**

    At Runtastic, I worked as Software Engineer in the Data Team. My main focus is on data architecture design, managing data exchange with adidas, and improving our data platform and CI/CD.

    - I contributed to the migration of data and data platform to a cloud based solution, based on Databricks and Microsoft Azure.
    - I took part in designing and implementing the architecture of our data platform, including the ETL pipelines, systems to ensure GDPR compilance and data quality, CI/CD tooling, ad alerting.
    - I have implemented data products connected to backend services such as follower recommendations and retention models.
    - In Q1 2022, I worked in the Android Team developing new features for the adidas Running and adidas Training android apps.
    - In Q3 2022, I worked with the adidas sales Data & Analytics team advising on best practices and collaborating with the team to implement the first ETL streaming pipeline serving an almost real-time dashboard used for making quick decisions during key selling moments (e.g., Black Friday).
   
    - **Technologies**: Python, PySpark, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, Kotlin

- **[2018-2019] Software Engineer and Researcher at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)**

    - I worked on a European funded project (EIT Digital) in the fintech domain. I developed a new 
state-of-the-art blackbox testing tool to run functional and security tests on RESTful APIs. The 
associated [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9159077/) won the 
Distinguished Paper Award at the ICST 2020 conference. Previously, I worked on a [block-box security 
testing tool](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220301163) for Ethereum Smart 
Contract.  

    - In Q4 2019 I was Teaching assistant for the master course titled "Security Testing" at the University of Trento. Topics: OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities and how to write automatic test-cases using Selenium to attack and 
assert the fix of the vulnerable applications.

    - **Technologies**: Python, Z3, Blockchain (Ethereum), Solidity, Web3JS, Truffle Framework, Node.JS, 
Java, Gradle.
